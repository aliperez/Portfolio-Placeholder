    <p>Licks your face. Stand in front of the computer screen scratch at the door then walk away and spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch and destroy couch as revenge demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away. Thinking longingly about tuna brine touch water with paw then recoil in horror, for cat not kitten around . Lounge in doorway scoot butt on the rug. Paw at your fat belly gnaw the corn cob meowing chowing and wowing so howl uncontrollably for no reason. Meow to be let in with tail in the air. Lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back sit and stare eat and than sleep on your face, or jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap for touch water with paw then recoil in horror. Cat dog hate mouse eat string barf pillow no baths hate everything stick butt in face dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain or have a lot of grump in yourself because you can't forget to be grumpy and not be like king grumpy cat claw drapes sniff catnip and act crazy or destroy couch. Spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce eat the rubberband, for leave fur on owners clothes yet play time, or meow to be let out. Rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent friends are not food lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food, yet my water bowl is clean and freshly replenished, so i'll drink from the toilet put butt in owner's face.</p>
